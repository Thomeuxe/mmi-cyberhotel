# mmi-cyberhotel
This is a teaching project for the Modeling and Advanced databases course, in the MMI option at IUT1 Grenoble, France.

The objective of the project is to illiustrate the complete lifecycle of a small web application. Starting from
analysis a conceptual model was developed, that will be progresively refined into a full working application.

The conceptual data model will be mapped to a PHP class model (using synfony framework) and persistency will be handled
by the ORM (Doctrine)
